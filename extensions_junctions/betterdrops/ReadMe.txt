Description

Ship mods t1-t3 as well as Seminars of lvl 1-4 now drop more often from many different game activities and are also given as a reward in missions. Overall chance and quantity of all the drops increased across the game. Exploration, lockboxes, missions, crystals and loot from destroyed ships - should all be more exquisite now.

Purpose of the mod

Since modded game doesn't support ventures, this mod increases most of the game's drop lists. Makes finding lockboxes and fighting enemy ships more exciting and lowers the tidium of pilot skillincrease, by supplying your with more seminars. Works well with other mods, except the ones that directly adjust drops in game.
